ðŸŽ¶ Instrument patches to play MIDI files with the [Web MIDI Player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-midi-player).

The patches are available via the [jsDeliver CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/midi-instrument-patches).

They can be downloaded in a single ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/yvesgurcan/midi-instrument-patches/releases/latest/download/patches.zip).

The instrument patches are meant to be used with a version of [libTimidity](http://libtimidity.sourceforge.net/) converted to JavaScript thanks to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/). The files are loaded dynamically when playing a MIDI file that requires instrument data. Compatibility with other libraries is not guaranteed.
